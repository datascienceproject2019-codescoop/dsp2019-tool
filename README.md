# Backend

## How to install

It's easy.

## How to develop the API

Easy way to send requests to the backend is to use Visual Code with this extension called https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client

Anyway after installing those simply open the `api-stuff.http` file and "Send Request" option should appear before any of the requests. Click that and it will send the request with parameters described in the text. Cool!
